The overall purpose of this code is to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict a candidate's 'Job Role' based on their skills, experience, education, certifications, and project count. This involves data loading, comprehensive preprocessing including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and binarizing skills. After preprocessing, feature selection is performed to identify the most relevant features. Finally, several classification models (Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Network, and Decision Tree) are trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and cross-validation.
